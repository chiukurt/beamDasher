### TODO / Current questions
 
* Optimize collision detection

        Split the map into 'chunks' 
        Perform collision detection only within these localized areas
        
        Extend Renderable to create a 'Collidable' class
        Eventually extend Collidable to create a 'Movable' class
        
        
        
        
 
* Customize lighting

      Distinguish between Renderable objects that are and aren't affected by lighting
 
* Make a UI that follows the player camera and angle
